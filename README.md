# BrazilEDA

We used data from [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/data/) and permofed some ETL and EDA using some indicators from Brazil.

We conclude that life expectancy in Brazil has increased in the last 80 years and that the general infrastructure conditions in Brazil have also kept pace with this growth, including paving, sanitation and water supply. This growth has occurred mainly in rural areas. We found a high correlation of sanitation and water supply with life expectancy rates. On the other hand, the perception of corruption did not present conclusive data when compared to the infrastructure data.
